Build a static single-page website that showcases my design skills and understanding of SEO best practices.

The site should:

Have an outstanding, modern, and elegant design

Be fully responsive across all devices

Use clean HTML semantics (e.g., header, main, article, section, footer)

Be highly accessible and keyboard-navigable

Include meta tags, OpenGraph tags, alt attributes, schema.org, etc.

Have excellent core web vitals (fast, lightweight, optimized images, no layout shifts)

💡 The content and layout should follow this structure:

🌟 Page Title: "Rank Higher, Convert Better: SEO Design That Works"
🟢 Hero Section
Headline:
“Beautiful Design Meets Search Engine Performance”

Subheadline:
“A perfectly optimized static page, designed to impress users and Google alike.”

CTA Button: "Explore the Design"

Background: sleek gradient or large SVG illustration

Include a testimonial quote in a badge or card format (e.g., “This is how SEO pages should look!”)

🎨 Section 1: Why Design Matters in SEO
Headline:
“Design is Not Just Looks – It’s Structure, Speed, and Experience”
